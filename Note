Styling React Using CSS
There are many ways to style React with CSS, this tutorial will take a closer look at three common ways:
Inline styling
CSS stylesheets
CSS Modules





Hooks => allow function components to have access to state and other React features.
Because of this, class components are generally no longer needed

The React useState Hook allows us to track state in a function component.
State generally refers to data or properties that need to be tracking in an application

Initialize useState
We initialize our state by calling useState in our function component.

useState =>  accepts an initial state and returns two values:
The current state.
A function that updates the state

//Local-Storage=> is an object not a method and not a function but it's a part of web storage API & provide,method for storing and accessing data locally in the users web browser.
It cant work alone without the help of JSON.stringify or JSON.parse.


PROPS => this is a property.
React Props are like function arguments in JavaScript and attributes in HTML.

PROP DRILLING => this allow us to pass a data from a parent component to child component.

useRef
useRef is a React Hook that lets you reference a value thatâ€™s not needed for rendering.
